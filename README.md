## 📖 About This Project

This portfolio was created to showcase the projects I've completed as a solo developer.  
Its main purpose is to demonstrate my experience across various types of development and my expertise with different technologies.

On the site, you’ll find everything from simple landing pages and online stores to full-featured applications with complex business logic.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Some projects may not include live preview links, as they are no longer active or relevant for the original clients.  
> If needed, feel free to contact me — I’ll be happy to provide full layout previews or visual demos of any specific project.

## 🧩 Status

✅ Actively maintained — new projects are added regularly
